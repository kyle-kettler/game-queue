# GameQueue
A frontend web app created for gamers to keep track of the games they want to play.

## Why I Built this App
I love video games, and there are many games I want to play, so many that it is hard to remember them all. So I made this little app to help. 

## Technologies Used
- Vanilla Javascript
- AJAX
- RAWG API for game data
- CSS3
- HTML5
- Localstorage to save user data

## Live Demo

## Features

- Users can save games as 'played' or 'want to play'
- Users can rate the games they have played
- Users can create a separate list of their favorite games
